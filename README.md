# MATH 230-1: Multivariable Differential Calculus

Materials for Northwestern University's [MATH 230-1: Multivariable Differential Calculus, Fall 2023](https://class-descriptions.northwestern.edu/4920/WCAS/MATH/16553). For some inscrutable reason, Prof Santiago Cañez's MATH 230-1 section isn't listed among the 2023 Fall Math department [offerings](https://class-descriptions.northwestern.edu/4920/WCAS/MATH), but he was the instructor whose lectures I attended.

Includes Prof Cañez's written lecture notes.
